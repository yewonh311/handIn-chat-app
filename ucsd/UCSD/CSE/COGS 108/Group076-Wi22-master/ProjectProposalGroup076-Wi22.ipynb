    "Introduction\n",
    "With rising tuition costs and a higher saturation of individuals with higher education entering the market each year, one begins to wonder if paying for a graduate degree is still worth it. There is no doubt that earning a graduate degree is difficult and costly. Many companies and research institutions rely on the work of those with graduate degrees in order to increase their profit margins. Thus these companies are willing to largely fund research and development. This combined with the difficulty and time required to obtain a graduate degree leads us to believe it is more likely the income for those with graduate degrees should be much higher than average. A higher income can allow one to afford a better quality of life (including a higher cost of living) which could lead to increased happiness.  In our study, we are attempting to evaluate if a relationship exists between obtaining a graduate degree,  house value, and increased happiness metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior Work:\n",
    "After some initial research, we found income does in fact increase with a graduate degree. In an article by US News(1), it was found that the median annual earnings for full-time workers holding a bachelor's degree was $66,536, a master's 81,636 dollars, and a doctoral was 127,487 dollars. This article aimed to weigh potential earnings against graduate school costs. Graduate school debt increased gradually from 2011 to 2017. Some degrees such as a master's in social work have a median debt of 115,000 dollars while first-year earnings are only 49,400 dollars. Despite this data, it seems possible that choosing a graduate degree in some industries can yield more profit for an individual. So depending on the industry of the degree it may or may not make economic sense to obtain a degree. \n",
    "\n",
    "A news article (2) seems to agree with the idea that there is a positive correlation between obtaining higher education and happiness. The article summarizes several studies which evaluate different aspects most associated with happiness. Some of which include long-term health, stable marriages, and more income. These studies show a positive correlation between higher education and the aforementioned aspects. \n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that having a graduate school diploma will be (positively) correlated with a higher house value and happiness index. We believe this is the case because having a graduate degree results in having more competitive qualifications which leads to earning a higher income. However, we acknowledge earning a graduate degree can require accepting loans which could counter the added income. "

    "* In order to successfully complete the project, our group must comply with the deadline according to our timeline proposal, but we believe that the project objectives should not be sloppy in order to meet the deadline. We will do all the work within the given range, within data sets, to access the data we selected efficiently and analytically. Also, we will always keep in mind what we want to know and what we think the business problem we are trying to know and solve is the foundation of data analysis. For this, we always try to focus on communication and conflict resolution.\n",
    "* External data sources, such as open data sets that are now publicly available, are growing rapidly. There are also easy ways to retrieve data from the web and bring it into a usable format, such as scraping techniques. These methods can be useful in an academic environment, but we will try to utilize the original data source whenever possible."
